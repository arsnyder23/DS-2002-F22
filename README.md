The data used here is given in the northwind and northwind-data files.

Lab 1 uses simple SQL queries to analyze the Northwind OLTP database.

Lab 2 performs an ETL in a MySQL server to reorganize the Northwind Data into an OLTP star schema data warehouse.

Lab 2 x adds and integrates a date dimension to the star schema from Lab 2.

Lab 3 performs the same ETL as Lab 2 using python to access the MySQL server and perform ETL methods using Pandas libraries and execute SQL queries.

Lab 4 performs the same ETL as Lab 2 using python to access the MySQL server and a MongoDB Atlas Cluster where the data is stored.
